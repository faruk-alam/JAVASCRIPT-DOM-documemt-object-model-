THE DOM API
The DOM API (Application Programming Interface) is essentially the gateway between your HTML document 
rendered on the web and your JavaScript.
The DOM API provides a set of properties and methods which makes it possible to access information about 
our document or specific elements inside our script, as well as change their state on the browser.
In other words, JavaScript interacts with the page through the DOM API

EXAMINING THE DOCUMENT OBJECT
Console.dir(document)
Console.dir(document) gives us an interactive representation of our document. Interactive because it 
becomes very easy to expand the document object and inspect the properties and methods inside the 
document object.

Checking for the Document Type
console.log(document.doctype)
There have been various versions of HTML Markup since its invention in 1993. With the doctype property, 
we can get information about the type and version of the HTML Markup being used in the document

Time of last modification
console.log(document.lastModified)
We can also check to see when last our document (HTML) was modified. The above code will log the 
information to the console.View the head part of the HTML Document

console.log(document.head)
This will log the HTML head tag as well as every other tags nested inside of it

Get the Body of the document
console.log(document.body)
This logs a HTML representation of the body tag and all nested tags, onto the browser console

Get the Form(s) within the document.
console.log(document.forms)
This will return a HTMLCollection (similar to an array) showing the number of forms (if any) present 
in the document as well as their index properties.

Get the entire HTML mark up
console.log(document.all)
This will log the entire markup within the HTML document onto the console. In our case, a 
HTMLCollection containing 25 items (HTML elements) will be shown on the console
