The Dom and Trees :
The DOM is often referred to as the DOM tree, and consists of a tree of objects called nodes.
All items in the DOM are defined as nodes. There are many types of nodes, but there are three main ones 
that we work with most often:

Element nodes
Text nodes
Comment nodes

When an HTML element is an item in the DOM, it is referred to as an element node. Any lone text outside of 
an element is a text node, and an HTML comment is a comment node. In addition to these three node types, 
the document itself is a document node, which is the root of all other nodes.

Identifying Node Type
Every node in a document has a node type, which is accessed through the nodeType property. Below is a chart 
of the most common node types:

Node Type	   Value	      Example
ELEMENT_NODE	1	       The <body> element
TEXT_NODE	    3	       Text that is not part of an element
COMMENT_NODE	8	       <!-- an HTML comment -->

Navigating Between DOM Nodes-
Parent Nodes
The nodes in the DOM are referred to as parents, children, and siblings, depending on their relation to 
other nodes. The parent of any node is the node that is one level above it, or closer to the document in 
the DOM hierarchy. There are two properties to get the parent â€” parentNode and parentElement.

Property	                                    Gets
parentNode	                                    Parent Node
parentElement	                                Parent Element Node

Children Nodes
The children of a node are the nodes that are one level below it. Any nodes beyond one level of nesting are 
usually referred to as descendants.

Property	                                Gets
childNodes	                                Child Nodes
firstChild	                                First Child Node
lastChild	                                Last Child Node
children Element                            Child Nodes
firstElementChild	                        First Child Element Node
lastElementChild	                        Last Child Element Node

Sibling Nodes
The siblings of a node are any node on the same tree level in the DOM. Siblings do not have to be the same 
type of node - text, element, and comment nodes can all be siblings.
