Creating New Nodes
In a static website, elements are added to the page by directly writing HTML in an .html file. In a dynamic 
web app, elements and text are often added with JavaScript. The createElement() and createTextNode() methods 
are used to create new nodes in the DOM.

Property/Method	Description
createElement()	Create a new element node
createTextNode()	Create a new text node

Inserting Nodes into the DOM
In order to see the new text nodes and elements we create on the front end, we will need to insert them into 
the document. The methods appendChild() and insertBefore() are used to add items to the beginning, middle, 
or end of a parent element, and replaceChild() is used to replace an old node with a new node.

Property/Method                          	Description
node.appendChild()	         Add a node as the last child of a parent element
node.insertBefore()	         Insert a node into the parent element before a specified sibling node
node.replaceChild()	         Replace an existing node with a new node

There is a another way,we can add element,by using prepend() and InnerText method.This method add element
beginning of the document body.
