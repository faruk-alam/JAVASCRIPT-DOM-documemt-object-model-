Removing Existing Elements from DOM
Similarly, you can use the removeChild() method to remove a child node from the DOM. This method also returns 
the removed node. 

It is also possible to remove the child element without exactly knowing the parent element. Simply find the 
child element and use the parentNode property to find its parent element. This property returns the parent 
of the specified node in the DOM tree.
